Abstract
=======================

Predicting the type of sentiment associated with the reviews provided by the users on a cell phone through Amazon website. Multinomial Naive Bayes model was trained for the prediction as the scenario involved text classification. This prediction would be useful for a new user who is trying to look for specific things before buying a new cell phone online by automatically identifying the prominent emotion of the review. 

Introduction
=======================

Whenever a user tries to find a reliable review before buying a cellphone online, it becomes very confusing as the number of reviews of all phones by famous brands would be very large in number. It becomes cumbersome to go through each review; this model becomes very useful as people can filter out which type and brand of phone they want/do not want to use.
